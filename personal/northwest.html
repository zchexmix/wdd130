                    <p>Starting with Liverpool! an Incredible city and plenty to go and see. Lets start with some of the tourist-y things. The beatles museum: Some may roll their eyes at this and thats okay. But its a worthwhile visit. Let me give a quick summary. Located near the liverpool dock, it goes down into a basment maze that runs you along the entire history of the famous rock band. How they each started and every detail you can imagine that goes with that. They even have replicas of pubs that they began at. If you are a muscial person, Its well worth the visit! </p>

                    <p>Howarth Howarth is an incredble little village in yorkshire. All the cobblestone roads and small shops around the town are amazing. Dont forget to stop in at ____ and get some hot chocolate! If you start your journey in Keighley there is also a very cool steam train ride that you can take right into Howarth. </p>

                    <p> Lake district Hellvelyn is the second highest peak in England. For those that like to get out and exercise this is perfect. Its not the most challenging hike but it will take several hours so plan accordingly. There is a rock scrambling bit at the top that may not be best for young children.</p>
