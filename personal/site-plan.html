      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>To create a simple place to find amazing local locations that not many are familiar with and showing others what local trasures there are close by. This will lay out a few sections of England and show others some places near and far from their local towns. This will be to the go-to site for staycations around England.</p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>Anyone and everyone that is looking for a small trip or vacation that doesnt want to pay for the overpriced luxuries of the rest of Europe. Those that want a staycation close by that they can go enjoy.</p>  <!-- change this -->

        North-West
        Welcome to the North-West! Here youll find some of the finest fish n chips in the nation!
        I will be using Liverpool and Manchester as a bit of a guide as they are two major cities in the northwast of England. 
        Starting with Liverpool! an Incredible city and plenty to go and see. Lets start with some of the tourist-y things. 
        The beatles museum: Some may roll their eyes at this and thats okay. But its a worthwhile visit. Let me give a quick summary. Located near the liverpool dock, it goes down into a basment maze that runs you along the entire history of the famous rock band. How they each started and every detail you can imagine that goes with that. They even have replicas of pubs that they began at. If you are a muscial person, Its well worth the visit!

        Howarth
        Howarth is an incredble little village in yorkshire. All the cobblestone roads and small shops around the town are amazing. Dont forget to stop in at ____ and get some hot chocolate!

        Bolton Abbey
        An amazing Abbey rich with history and beautiful grounds to walk around. There is a river there with a fun stone cross way as well as a bridge for those who dont want to risk falling in. POerfect to bring the family out as there are usually ice cream and other food trucks on the premises.

        Peak Disrtict
        The Chatsworth house is an amazing stop in the peak district. Pride and prejedice was filmed there. You can take a tour of the building as well as the grounds surrounding. they have barnes converted into restaurants and bakerys for when you get hungry. Well worth the trip out there!

        Lake district
        Hellvelyn is the second highest peak in England. For those that like to get out and exercise this is perfect. Its not the most challenging hike but it will take several hours so plan accordingly. There is a rock scrambling bit at the top that may not be best for young children.

      <h3>[Page 3]</h3>
      <p>
        Welcome to the Northeast!
        We will start with York. My favorite town in the entiret of England. There is so much history here its fun to walk along the old city walls and up to where the castle ruins are. York Minster is probably the crown jewel. It is an amazing piece of architecture that is worth spending the day around and trying to go to Evensong

        Next is Flamborough
        amazing sea side town with shops, carnival, and some amazing fish and chips if you are interested. A great place to stay on the English coast

        Whitby
        Beautiful landscape and some amazing castle ruins. It is a must for anyone that can make a day trip out it.

      <p>
        South-West!
        Welcome to the South-West!
        First is Cornwall
        There are too many places to count that are perfect in Cornwall. But I'll just list a couple. St Ives is a great town. great beaches and wonderful food. If you can spend the day here do it! Tintagel Castle is another amazing visit1 But be ready for the climb in and out getting down to the castle!

        Next is Bath. The buildings are incredible and the food just as good. You can spend hours just wandering the streets looking at the amazing houses there. Do uorself a favor and spend the money to go see the roman baths as well as going and finding some amazing food.

        Cotswolds

        The most relaxing place on earth? Every town is just the most peaceful scenic place youll ever see. There are a few tourist hotspots there so watch out because the crowds are wild!

      <h3>[Page 5]</h3>
      <p>
        South-East!
        London is obviosuly where we start over her. The options are limitless. My only advice is to go see something on west end, use the tube, and dont be afraid to try everything you see!

        Next is Brighton
        A great town on the southern border. It has loads of shopping around the beach. streets and streets of stores and shops. Take the day and wander through the town and you wont regret it!

        Dover is another great coastal town. The castle is beautiful and there is a short walk you can do along the cliffs that leads to a lighthouse. It is well worth a day trip.

        Last but not least is Canterbury. The Minster is incredible but be aware - access to get up close closes around 6pm. So get there early! Great food and pubs surround the Church and is overall great to wander around.
